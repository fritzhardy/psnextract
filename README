DESCRIPTION
    Psnextract is a tool intended to gather trophy data from PlayStation
    Network, parsing downloaded html for use building external web pages.

INSTALLATION
    Script requirements are as follows:

     HTML::TokeParser::Simple;

    Installation consists of merely untarring the script, and likely making
    use of the included graphics with the include argument. At this time,
    html output formatting and styles are hardcoded, so any customization
    must be done via programmatic changes within the script.

OPTIONS
    -d, --dry-run
        Do not actually do any operations. Combines well with --verbose to
        debug problems.

    -h, --help
        Print brief usage message.

    -i, --include=/path/to/include/graphics
        Path to directory of graphics and other items to include when
        building web. The include directory provided in the package includes
        all items necessary for building web pages as is done in the
        write_html function. Adjustments to that function may well require
        additions to include.

    -o, --override=/path/to/override
        File of corrections and additions with which to override game and
        trophy values parsed from html. Format is item|attribute=value. See
        OVERRIDES.

    --uk=/path/to/uk_psn.html
        File of UK PSN html save-as-webpage data to parse. Assumes Firefox
        format, with file uk_psn.html and accompanying directory
        uk_psn_files.

    --us=/path/to/us_psn.html
        File of US PSN html save-as-webpage data to parse. Assumes Firefox
        format, with file us_psn.html and accompanying directory
        us_psn_files.

    -v, --verbose
        Control vebosity of output. Increase by passing multiple times.

    -w, --web=/path/to/webdir
        Web destination to which include graphics and items are copied, and
        inside which index.html is written from parsed data.

MULTIPLE HTML SOURCES
    The purpose for supporting both US and UK data sources and merging them
    with overrides is the following observation:

     US: Datestamps, bigger trophy graphics, often missing or delayed DLC
     UK: No datestamps, always up-to-date DLC

    The main issue is missing DLC. As such, the sources are overlayed on top
    of one another: UK -> US -> overrides. UK data to provide data for all
    trophies minus datestamps, US to fill in missing datestamps and provide
    nicer graphics, and lastly overrides to fill in any missing info.

    In most cases, US data is all that is needed to provide all info.

OVERRIDES
    The overrides facility is used to provide missing info, corrections,
    addendums, and any caption desired for web output. Overrides are one per
    line, in format item|attribute=value. Example specifying all possible
    overrides:

     game|title=>Game of the Ages
     game|caption=>This is a terrific game
     game|img=>awesome.jpg
     game|user=>foobar
     game|avatar=>foobar.jpg
     game|progress=>50
     game|bronze=>12
     game|silver=>34
     game|gold=>56
     game|platinum=>78
     1|date=>Fri Aug 24 22:49:00 EDT 2012
     2|date=>Fri Aug 24 20:45:00 EDT 2012
     3|date=>Fri Nov 12 22:22:00 EST 2010
     4|date=>Fri Aug 31 21:44:00 EDT 2012
     5|date=>Sun Sep 16 15:15:00 EDT 2012

    Every game line is overriding info that will appear in the masthead,
    while numbered lines provide info for the given trophy. It is most
    common to use the overrides file only to specify caption, and in the
    event of missing DLC, trophy date.

EXAMPLES
    Parse US PSN data:
         psnextract.pl --us=gamedata_us.html

    See lots of verbose output:
         psnextract.pl -v -v -v -v --us=gamedata_us.html

    Also parse UK PSN data:
         psnextract.pl --us=gamedata_us.html --uk=gamedata_uk.html

    Add in overrides:
         psnextract.pl --us=gamedata_us.html --uk=gamedata_uk.html \
         --override=override.txt

    Now build a web page with it all:
         psnextract.pl --us=gamedata_us.html --uk=gamedata_uk.html \
         --override=override.txt --web=webdir

    Include graphics for complete html output:
         psnextract.pl --us=gamedata_us.html --uk=gamedata_uk.html \
         --override=override.txt --include=includedir --web=webdir
